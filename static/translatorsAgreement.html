        accept our confidentiality
        agreement.</h3>
    <p>
        This agreement, between Universal Translation Services (hereinafter "UTS"), and THE TRANSLATOR (hereinafter
        "Independent Contractor" - "IC"), defines the respective rights,
        duties and obligations of the aforementioned parties in connection with any and all language services
        performed by IC on behalf of one or more of the clients of UTS,
        whether or not such services are performed at the behest of UTS.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>WHEREAS, UTS is in the business of providing language services to individuals, business entities, and
        governmental agencies; and</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        WHEREAS, THE TRANSLATOR is a qualified language instructor / interpreter / translator (circle appropriate
        title) who wishes to undertake assignments in his/her specialty
        area(s) as an IC for UTS;
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>1. GENERAL</h3>
    <p>
        IC understands and agrees that UTS will be utilizing his/her services only on an as-needed basis, based
        solely upon the demand of UTS's clients for UTS's services. Thus,
        UTS cannot guarantee any minimum amount of work. However connected to Tranwise you will get all jobs offered
        in your language combiantion which you have specified in
        Tranwise. Moreover, it is possible that there will be no demand whatsoever by UTS's clients for IC's
        language specialty during any specified period of time, and it is also
        possible that such demand as there is may not be sufficient to warrant UTS's contacting IC. In view of the
        foregoing, IC may, without penalty, decline to accept any offered
        assignment from UTS.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>2. PROCEDURE</h3>
    <p>
        When UTS receives a request for language services from one of its clients requiring IC's language specialty,
        and wishes to engage IC's services, UTS will then offer the
        assignment to IC through Tranwise or by email, who may, as provided in Paragraph 1, above, decline to accept
        said assignment. If IC agrees to accept the assignment, he/she
        agrees to accept compensation in the manner and amount agreed in advance, and hereby further agrees to
        adhere fully to all internal UTS procedures, including quality
        control procedures, set forth in the Business Unit's SOP, as well as to all other terms and conditions
        outlined therein.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>3. IC QUALIFICATIONS</h3>

        of quality control by UTS, IC further agrees that he/she will
        submit to procedures outlined in Tranwise. Adherence by IC to the foregoing UTS internal procedures,
        including quality control procedures, is a material provision of this
        agreement. Because adherence to UTS's internal procedures is an integral part of IC's responsibilities, such
        adherence is not separately compensated or paid for by UTS, but
        is rather hereby expressly included in the UTS IC compensation set forth in Paragraph 5, below.

        deposits, payments and other remittances in connection with UTS language services are to be made directly to
        UTS. Strict adherence to this provision is a material condition
        of this agreement, and any failure to observe this condition shall constitute a material breach of this

    <p>
        UTS may accept assignments containing protected health information (PHI) or electronic protected health

        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any individually identifiable health information
        associated with an assignment shall be protected by IC during the
        performance of an assignment for UTS.<br /><br />
        Data that is "individually identifiable" includes any piece of information that can be used, either alone or
        in combination, to identify an individual. Under HIPAA,
        Protected Health Information (PHI) is information that identifies an individual (in this case UTS' clients)
        and relates to the following:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>The Client's past, present, or future physical or mental health</li>
        <li>The provision of healthcare to the Client</li>
        <li>The past, present, or future payment for health care</li>
        <li>The Client's personally identifiable information (PII) including date of birth, policy number, address,
            telephone numbers, fax number, email address, social security number, medical record number, account
            number, certificate/license number, health plan beneficiary number</li>
        <li>Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code.</li>
    </ul>
    All of the above identifiers about UTS' clients shall not be disclosed by IC, except as required by Law. Upon
    termination of the Agreement for any reason, IC shall destroy
    all Protected Health Information received from UTS, or created, maintained, or received by IC on behalf of
    Client that the IC still maintains in any form. IC shall retain
    no copies of the Protected Health Information.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>14. NON-EXCLUSIVITY</h3>
    <p>
        Recognizing that UTS may not ever, or may only on an occasional basis, have an assignment to offer to IC, IC
        shall have the right to accept assignments from other
        companies; provided however, that IC nevertheless shall remain obligated to adhere to the provisions of this
        agreement concerning confidentiality and direct solicitation of
        UTS's clients.
