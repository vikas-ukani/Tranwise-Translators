    tagEditorHelp: `Very important when working with TagEditor.
    
1. Make sure that before you open tageditor that you have workbench opened in the right language combination or you make a new one.
    
2. Very important is the ini file. The ini file has to be selected before you start with your translation. Not only important for the translation but also for the proofreader otherwise we can never convert it back.

3. Open the file in tageditor that you have to translate or proofread.

4. After your translation make sure that you VERIFY TAGS. In this way you check if you have not touch any code in the document. Tageditor will show you the tags that are not correct or touched during translation.

5. Always deliver ttx files after your translation and after proofreading ttx and target files.

If you do not know how to work with TagEditor, please follow the online course.
To follow the online Trados course you can go to the website:

    qaHelp: `CAT Tool projects will be accompanied by a mandatory QA report. In this way, you can easily check for any errors (missing tags, inconsistencies, numeric mismatches, spelling and terminology) you might have made in the documents and will save you a lot of time. To generate these reports you will need APSic Xbench.
